This project analyzes the Titanic dataset using Python. The main goal is to explore the passenger data and build a predictive model to determine the survival chances.

Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Steps:

Data cleaning (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)

Exploratory Data Analysis (visualizing survival rates by gender, class, age, etc.)

Feature selection and preprocessing

Model building using Logistic Regression

Evaluating model performance (accuracy score, confusion matrix)

The project demonstrates skills in data wrangling, visualization, and applying machine learning models for classification problems.

ðŸ‘‰ "This is one of the classic beginner projects in Data Science."
